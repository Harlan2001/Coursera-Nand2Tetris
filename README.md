# NandToTetris

This course is divided into two parts: hardware and software.In the hardware section, students will enter the world of 01, construct logic circuits using and not gates, and gradually build a CPU to run a set of simple assembly code defined by the course author.In the software section, students will write a compiler that compiles a high-level language developed by the author called Jack into bytecode that can be run on a virtual machine and then further translated into assembly code.Students will also develop a simple OS that allows the computer to support input/output graphical interfaces.At this point, you can develop a small game of Tetris with Jack, compile it into assembly code, run it on the CPU you built with and not gates, and interact with the OS you developed.After learning this course, I have a global and profound understanding of the entire computer architecture, which will be of great help to my study in the following courses.
